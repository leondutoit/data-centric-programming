data-centric-programming
========================

I work with data in programmatic ways almost every day. I've been doing so for a few years in different settings. Along the way I gather many resources for learning like books, blogs that are immensely helpful to me. In my day job I also develop programming patterns that are handy to solve data-centric problems.

I want to share the insights I gain and the help I find along the way - that is why I am keeping [this wiki about data-centric programming](https://github.com/leondutoit/data-centric-programming/wiki). In addition to programming examples and explanations the wiki also contains some general advice for progressing as a software developer.

For the moment the programming examples are presented in Python and R. More languages will probably join the party in the future.
